# Project

# Context:

I'm currently studying engineering in the biotechnology field.
I work a lot with biological material. DNA sequences (coded by 4 different letters) are first transcribed into RNA (coded by 4 different letters, one of which is different from DNA). Subsequently, this RNA is translated into protein for metabilism operation. 
Proteins are sequences of amino acids (there are over 22 different ones).
In RNA, each 3-letter condon codes for an amino acid in the protein sequence.

The aim of the program I want to write is to give a coding DNA sequence.
Thanks to this sequence, there will be two outputs.
The first is the RNA sequence and the second is the protein sequence.

This program can be very useful, because sometimes scientists have to transcribe and translate by hand.
